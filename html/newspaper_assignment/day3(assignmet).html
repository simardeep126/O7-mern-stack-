                NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday, in his first public response to the Pahalgam terror attack, delivered a stern warning to those behind the killing of 26 civilians in Kashmir. Reflecting the government’s tough stance, Shah said, “Whoever carried out dastardly attack in Pahalgam will not be spared,” adding, “Har vyakti ko chun chun ke jawab bhi milega, jawab bhi diya jayega.

                    In the vast expanse of the universe, a thousand unknown planets drift silently through the cosmic abyss, each holding secrets yet to be uncovered. Some are shrouded in swirling storms, their atmospheres thick with gases never seen on Earth. Others bask in the light of distant, dying stars, their landscapes frozen in time. Alien oceans ripple under unfamiliar moons, while mountains of crystal stretch towards violet skies. The life that may exist on these worlds is beyond human imagination—bioluminescent

                    The crowd seemed to grow, swelling with energy as more people gathered. Voices merged into a rhythmic hum, punctuated by bursts of laughter and animated conversations. Excitement rippled through the air, the anticipation building with each passing moment. Strangers became companions, drawn together by a shared experience. The atmosphere buzzed with movement—shuffling feet, waving hands, eager glances searching for something just beyond the horizon. As the gathering expanded, the space seemed to shrink, filled with the electric charge of expectation and the undeniable force of collective presence.
